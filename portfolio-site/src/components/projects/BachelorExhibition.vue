      Bachelor exhibition posters
    </h3>
    <p>
      These posters are the result of a collaborative effort of a group of graduate students at the University of Applied Sciences Trier for the Bachelor- and Masterexhibition.

      Each designer contributed a variety of graphical shapes which were then selected and put together into a coherent keyvisual by the group.
